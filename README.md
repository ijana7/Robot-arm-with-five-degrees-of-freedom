## Robot-arm-with-five-degrees-of-freedom

The design was created using the Shapr3D application, a powerful 3D design tool. Each motor in the arm has a dedicated mount, providing flexibility and precise control over the arm's movement. This design can serve as a basic model for developing advanced robotic systems or for educational and experimental purposes

## Here, hypothetically, we will put the first motor, and this will be considered the first motor of the five At the top will be the second motor that controls the directions of the entire arm

## Here is the third motor, and it will almost control the ability of the motor to rise and descend

## Here is the longest one, and of course the third motor will be inside it

## Here is the motor that will be inside, fixed to the bases of two bases on the right and left

## Here is the end effector, and These two pieces move by connecting two wires to them, and the two wires are taut and attached to the base that is mounted on the motor, so when it is twisted, the wires are pulled, and the two pieces become stuck to hold the objects.
